Hello world.

I have had a look at the program and I came out with a skeleton plan.
I propose the load tester to be as follows.
create a player thread(class),
the thread will act like a normal player by 
first send 'init' request and initilise itself
then send  'join' requet and join the game.
then send random play commands. ie a function called play that will play automatically by sending random commands to the server.
I have some variables like rtt(round_trip_time) for the player thread that stores the severs response time each time the thread sends a command(ie, 'init','join','move_Ä±p' etc)
and an artt(average_round_trip_time) variable that stores the overall servers response time for.
 Then increment these threads and look at how the 'artt' and other variables behave when the number of players(threads) increase.

 I am currently blocked with a "message protocol"
 User.send()
 {
 .......
		else if (SERVER2CLIENT[action].param[i] == 's')
		{
			//@fab
			System.out.println("sending (String):");
			bufferedOut.write((byte[])args[i], 0, Config.STRING_LENGTH); // Write String with constant length
		}
.....
}
